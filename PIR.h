 *
 * This library provides a hardware abstraction of a PIR (Pyroelectric InfraRed)
 * sensor. These sensors are typically used for motion detection. This is very
 * similar to a REX (Request-to-EXit) sensor which actually uses a PIR. The
 * difference is a REX includes a PIR, status LED, a relay and its own onboard
 * microcontroller. When the PIR trips, the onboard MCU will change the state of
 * one or more LEDs and then trigger a relay if the threshold is met. The REX
 * library is looking for that relay to short and react to it. This library, on
 * the other hand, is looking for a high/low state from an actual PIR sensor,
 * thus allowing you to build your own REX or other PIR application.
